Valon, as a sub-servicer, has the authority to do this on the master servicer's behalf. Valon, then, creates an invoice, which is a collection of expenses, and we track payments against those expenses.<\/SEARCH>\n<REPLACE>Additional Services Required When:\n1. Loans become delinquent\n2. Loans hit regulatory or contractual milestones\n   (See our comprehensive list of milestone triggers by loan type here)\n\nExample: Property Inspection Process\n1. When a loan becomes delinquent:\n   - Property must be checked for abandonment\n   - Valon can hire vendors for inspection\n   - Valon creates and tracks invoices for these expenses<\/REPLACE>\n\n<FILEPATH>fa_overview.txt<\/FILEPATH>\n<SEARCH>While the master servicer may directly pay out the services required, typically someone else must pick up the liability on the payment - either the homeowner, or the investor. From the point of view of the servicerWe say that the expense may be homeowner\/investor \"recoverable\".\n\nIn the case where an expense needs to ultimately be paid from the investor, the servicer (or Valon, in the servicer's behalf), must file claims. The servicer typically has a 45-60 day SLA (depending on the investor\/loan-type) after a milestone event in order to file these claims.<\/SEARCH>\n<REPLACE>Cost Payment and Recovery:\n1. Initial Payment:\n   - Master servicer pays for services upfront\n\n2. Cost Recovery:\n   - Expenses are \"recoverable\" from either:\n     * The homeowner\n     * The investor\n\n3. Investor Claims Process:\n   - When recovering from investors:\n     * Claims must be filed by servicer (or Valon)\n     * 45-60 day deadline after milestone event\n     * Exact deadline varies by investor and loan type<\/REPLACE>\n\nThese changes:\n1.
